# BadooNearbyAutolike [Blendr supported also]

Since online game is game of numbers, you most probably want to get in contact with as much people as possible and then pick out ones you like.

This is very simple script which will let you like all nearby online people with single click and then wait for them to like you back.

To get even more exposure, you can set predefined opener and send it to 20 online nearby people and, if they reply, you can continue conversation.

Notes:

Clicking mass like will get list of people based on people nearby list, so, there is where you set distance, age, sex, etc.

It will check if you liked first 100 people on list, it did not check before and like some of them. So, if tou want to like more people, click again.

It will probably at one moment say "Solve captcha" and, that is when you have to go to random profile and solve captcha, so, you can try again.

Make shure you set opener before using mass message!
